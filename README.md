# Well-Being

This project aims to reduce neonatal and under 5 mortality rates by the year 2030 through information dissemination and raising awareness. It utilizes an Artificial Conversational Entity powered by the Gemini API.

## Tech Stack

- Python: Python is used as the primary programming language for this project.
- Gemmini Pro & Gemmini Pro Vision API: These APIs provide advanced natural language processing and computer vision capabilities.
- Gradio: Gradio is used for building interactive UIs for the chat interface.
- Hugging Face spaces: Hugging Face spaces is used for collaborative development and deployment of the gradio application.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sitamgithub-MSIT/well-being.git`
2. Create a virtual environment: `conda create -n venv python=3.9 -y`
3. Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate venv`
4. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
5. Run the Gradio application: `python app.py`

Now, open up your local host and you should see the web application running. For more information, refer to the Gradio documentation [here](https://www.gradio.app/docs/interface). Also, a live version of the application can be found [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/sitammeur/Well_Being).

## Usage

Once the application is up and running, you can interact with the conversational entity through the provided UI. It can answer questions, provide information, and raise awareness about neonatal and under 5 mortality.
